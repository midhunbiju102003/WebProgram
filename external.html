<h1>EXTERNAL CSS</h1>
<p>External CSS is a method of applying styles to multiple HTML pages using a single CSS file. This approach helps maintain a consistent look and feel across a website by defining styles in a separate file with a .css extension. The CSS file contains style rules that target HTML elements using selectors such as classes, IDs, and tags</p>
<h3>Linking External CSS to HTML</h3>
<p>To link an external CSS file to an HTML document, use the <link> element within the <head> section of the HTML file. The rel attribute should be set to "stylesheet," and the href attribute should specify the path to the CSS file.</p></p>
